name:           reinforce-environments
version:        0.0.1.0
synopsis:       Reinforcement learning in Haskell
description:    See <https://github.com/Sentenai/reinforce README.md>. @reinforce@ is a library which exports an OpenAI-gym-like typeclass, @MonadEnv@, with both an interface to the <https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api/ gym-http-api>, as well as haskell-native environments which provide a substantial speed-up to the http-server interface.
                This is an environment-first library, with basic reinforcment learning algorithms being developed on branches in subpackages (see <https://github.com/Sentenai/reinforce#development-and-milestones Development and Milestones>). @reinforce@ is currently an "alpha" release since it still needs some work defining some formal structures around what state-spaces and action-spaces should look like, however haskell's typesystem is expressive enough that this seems to be more of a "nice-to-have."
                It's in active development and has some beginner-friendly contributions - from porting new gym environments to implementing new algorithms.
